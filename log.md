# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 09, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some basic HTML and CSS in FreeCodeCamp.
 

**Thoughts:** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of effort.


### Day 2: September 10, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Create README page. Learn different ways to set color values and how to pair colors with each other.

**Thoughts:** I have fun and look forward to climbing this huge mountain. Nevertheless, I need to spend more time on the GitHub platform to understand it better.
