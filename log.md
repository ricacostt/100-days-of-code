## Day 47: October 28, 2022
:running: Hackathon Day! 
In today's project the objective was: Build a REST API with Node.js, Express & PostgreSQL.
I am happy with the result and our determination and skill in solving problems and bugs that arose during the day.
It is a good starting point for a nice project in the future.

*The goal*: create a medical record that could be used by a therapist to store his personal clients‚Äô assessments.
üêòWe focused more on functionality than complexity and we created efficiently the tables and their respective columns with identity keys kept in mind, in elephantSQL. 
![Schermata 2022-10-29 alle 11 56 07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111753918/198827512-87fbe5aa-e763-46c4-a696-f792d36951f8.png)

Then straight into vscode taking care to make a set up that would allow us to separate concerns and keep sensitive information private.
:rocket: Built route handlers and functions that would allow the user to read all his patient info, filter searches, add new patients/treatments/medications or update them.

:heavy_check_mark: Tested eeach request in Postman.
